title: Use-cases and scenarios
---

Different use-cases and scenarios are supported. Below are a few to give an idea how the _UnifiedPush Server_ can be used:
* **MyWarehouseInc-backend** can send notification messages to different groups (e.g. discounts for only iOS (or only Android) users)
* **MyInsuranceCorp-backend** can send “notification messages” to different variants of its mobile Applications:
  * App for the Customers
  * App for the employed Sales Agents
* Publishing Company:
  * **MyPublishing-Company-backend** sends update “notification messages” to all of its apps (free and premium - regardless of the mobile OS)
  * **Targeting**: Sending push messages to different groups of users. For instance, availability of “advanced content” is only notified to the paying customers (e.g. those that run the premium app).
* A company has different backends (small/simple apps for different tasks) - and these different backends could be able to reach all (or some) of the company’s mobile apps.
